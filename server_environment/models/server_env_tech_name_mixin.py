class ServerEnvTechNameMixin(models.AbstractModel):
    """Provides a tech_name field to be used in server env vars as unique key.

    The `name` field can be error prone because users can easily change it
    to something more meaningful for them or set weird chars into it
    that make difficult to reference the record in env var config.
    This mixin helps solve the problem by providing a tech name field
    and a cleanup machinery as well as a unique constrain.

    To use this mixin add it to the _inherit attr of your module like:

        _inherit = [
            "my.model",
            "server.env.techname.mixin",
