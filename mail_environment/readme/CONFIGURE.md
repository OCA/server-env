With this module installed, the incoming and outgoing mail servers are
configured in the server_environment_files module (which is a module you
should provide, see the documentation of server_environment for more
information).

In the configuration file of each environment, you may first use the
sections \[outgoing_mail\] and \[incoming_mail\] to configure the
default values respectively for SMTP servers and the IMAP/POP servers.

Then for each server, you can define additional values or override the
default values with a section named \[outgoing_mail.resource_name\] or
\[incoming_mail.resource_name\] where "resource_name" is the name of the
server.

Example of config file :

    [outgoing_mail]
    smtp_host = smtp.myserver.com
    smtp_port = 587
    smtp_user =
    smtp_pass =
    smtp_encryption = ssl

    [outgoing_mail.odoo_smtp_server1]
    smtp_user = odoo
    smtp_pass = odoo

    [incoming_mail.odoo_pop_mail1]
    server = mail.myserver.com
    port = 110
    server_type = pop
    is_ssl = 0
    attach = 0
    original = 0
    user = odoo@myserver.com
    password = uas1ohV0

You will need to create 2 records in the database, one outgoing mail
server with the field name set to "odoo_smtp_server1" and one incoming
mail server with the field name set to "odoo_pop_mail1".

It is possible to use a SSL certificate for SMTP authentication. In this case,
you need to set the following entries in the configuration entry ::

  smtp_authentication = certificate
  smtp_ssl_certificate = <base64 encoded certificate>
  smtp_ssl_private_key = <base64 encoded certificate>
