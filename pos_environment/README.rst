This module extends the Odoo point of sale module to allow administrator
to customize the bill printed by the point of sale, with a text depending
on your environment. (Development, , Pre Production, Production, etc...)

This module is based on the mechanism introduced by the ``server_environment``
module.

   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Open your module ``server_environment_files``

* In each environment folder, create a new file named ``pos_environment.conf``
  (for exemple)

* In each file, write a section like this one, depending on your environment

::

    [pos_environment_header]
    line_1 = ===============================
    line_2 = TICKET EDITED ON A TEST
    line_3 = ENVIRONMENT
    line_4 = ===============================

    [pos_environment_footer]
    line_1 = ===============================
    line_2 = THIS TICKET HAS BEEN EDITED
    line_3 = ON A TEST ENVIRONMENT
    line_4 = -------------------------------
    line_5 = IT CAN NOT BE CONSIDERED
    line_6 = AS A PROOF OF PURCHASE
    line_7 = ===============================
