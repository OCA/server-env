This module allows to encrypt and decrypt data. This module is not usable
by itself, it is a low level module which should work as a base for others.
An example is the module server_environment_data_encryption

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to edit the main configuration file
of your instance, and add a directive called ``running_env``. Commonly
used values are 'dev', 'test', 'production'::

  [options]
  running_env=dev


You also need to set the encryption key(s). The main idea is to have different
encryption keys for your different environment, to avoid the possibility to retrieve
crucial information from the production environment in a developement environment, for instance.
So, if your running environment is 'dev'::

  [options]
  encryption_key_dev=fyeMIx9XVPBBky5XZeLDxVc9dFKy7Uzas3AoyMarHPA=

In the configuration file of your production environment, you may want to configure
all your other environments encryption key. This way, from production you can encrypt and decrypt
data for all environments.

You can generate keys with python -c 'from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print Fernet.generate_key()'.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

For now the encryption is dependent on the environment. It has been designed
to store the same kind of data with different values depending on the environement
(dev, preprod, prod...).
An improvement could be to split this in 2 modules. But the environment stuff
is not a big constraint.
