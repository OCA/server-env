**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to have the following modules installed and
properly configured: `server_environment module` `auth_saml`

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

Create a module server_environment_file with a cfg file or set the environment variable
SERVER_ENV_CONFIG with the following section:

[auth_saml_provider.<name>]

Where <name> is optional and must be equal to the name field you defined in Odoo for the IDP.


Example of configuration

[auth_saml_provider.my_idp]

idp_metadata=<...>
sp_baseurl=https://odoo-community.org
sp_pem_public_path=/data/cert.pem
sp_pem_private_path=/data/key.pem

Usage
=====

Once configured, Odoo will read the Auth SAML Providers values from the
configuration.

Note that visibility of login button for SAML is changed and differs from `auth_saml` module,
instead of relying on which fields are filled or not, all providers will be displayed as long
as their configuration in Odoo are set to active.

======================

* Due to the special nature of this addon, you cannot test it on the OCA
  runbot.
